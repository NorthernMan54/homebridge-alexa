# Installation of homebridge-alexa

* If you are looking for a basic setup to get this plugin up and running check out this guide (https://sambrooks.net/controlling-homebridge-using-alexa/).  And here is another setup guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylg4yiw8ofM).

## Prepare Homebridge for plugin installation

The setup of the plugin is very straight forward, and requires enabling insecure mode of each homebridge instance you want to control from Alexa.

1. All homebridge instances that you want to control from Alexa need to run in insecure mode with -I included on the command line.  How you make this change will depend on your installation of homebridge, and how you start homebridge.  If you start from the command line, it would look like this:

```
homebridge -I
```

* If your using systemd to manage homebridge, the -I is added to the file /etc/default/homebridge in the line, HOMEBRIDGE_OPTS ie.

```
# Defaults / Configuration options for homebridge
# The following settings tells homebridge where to find the config.json file and where to persist the data (i.e. pairing and others)
HOMEBRIDGE_OPTS=-I

# If you uncomment the following line, homebridge will log more
# You can display this via systemd's journalctl: journalctl -f -u homebridge
#DEBUG=
```

* If your using pm2 to manage the startup of homebridge, you can add the -I option with these steps

```
pm2 delete homebridge
pm2 cleardump
pm2 start homebridge -- -I
pm2 save
```
To review your settings, use command below to check if homebridge was sucessfully registered to pm2. After that, you can try to reboot your system and check whether you can control homebridge devices with Alexa app.


```
pm2 show homebridge
```


* If you have multiple homebridge options, the -I should be listed first. ie

```
HOMEBRIDGE_OPTS=-I -U /var/homebridge
```

* If you are running with a docker container ( Oznu's), you can add the -I flag following these instructions:

https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/79

```
Variable=HOMEBRIDGE_INSECURE
Value=1
```

```
Go to the Docker app
Stop the Homebridge container
Edit the container and go to the Environment tab
Add environment variable
Save and start container
```

## Install Plugin

2. The setup of homebridge-alexa is similar to other plugins, except it doesn't have any devices in the Home app;-)  I'm just reusing the runtime and configuration file management. And it only needs to installed once if you have multiple homeridge's installed.  It will auto-discover and connect to the other instances.

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-alexa
```

## Create homebridge-alexa account

3. An account to link your Amazon Alexa to HomeBridge needs to created on this website https://www.homebridge.ca/.  This account will be used when you enable the home skill in the Alexa App on your mobile, and in the configuration of the plugin in homebridge.


## HomeBridge-alexa plugin configuration

4. Add the plugin to your config.json.  The login and password in the config.json, are the credentials you created earlier for the https://www.homebridge.ca/ website.  This only needs to be completed for one instance of homebridge in your environment, it will discover the accessories connected to your other homebridges automatically.

],
```

#### filter
  - Limits accessories shared with Alexa to a single homebridge instance.  ( I'm using this setting with Amazon for skill testing. ).  The setting is ip:port of homebridge instance.

```
"platforms": [

  }
],
```

#### deviceList & deviceListHandling
  - allow or deny devices by name to be exposed to alexa.  Values are checked to see if they are contained within the name.  ( Under the covers it is using regex, so more complex options are available )

```
"platforms": [
  {
  "platform": "Alexa",
  "name": "Alexa",
  "username": "....",
  "password": "....",
  "deviceListHandling": "deny",   // or allow

    ]
  }
],
```

#### combine

```
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Alexa",

        }],
  }
],
```

* into - Device name to combine into
* from - Device name to combine from, can be a list of multiple devices.


#### speakers

```
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Alexa",
    "name": "Alexa",
    "username": "....",
    "password": "....",
    "speakers": [{
        "manufacturer": "...",

      {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "Panasonic"
      }
    ]
  }
```

#### Inputs

  - This combines several buttons that control inputs on a TV or Stereo into an Alexa input control and enables the phrase `Alexa, change to input to`. For the names of the inputs, Amazon provided a list ( see alexa name below ) that you can choose from.  You can map multiple alexa names to the same button as well.

`Alexa, change input to Tuner on the TV`

`Alexa, change input to HDMI 1 on the TV`

```
{
    "platform": "Alexa",
    "username": "...",
    "password": "...",
    "name": "Alexa",
    "inputs": [{
      "into": "TV",
      "devices": [{
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "Tuner",
        "alexaName": "TUNER"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "Tuner",
        "alexaName": "TV TUNER"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "Tuner",
        "alexaName": "TV"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "HDMI1",
        "alexaName": "HDMI 1"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "HDMI1",
        "alexaName": "TV KODI"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "HDMI1",
        "alexaName": "MEDIA PLAYER"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "HDMI2",
        "alexaName": "HDMI 2"
      }, {
        "manufacturer": "HTTP-IRBlaster",
        "name": "HDMI2",
        "alexaName": "TV NETFLIX"
      }]
    }],
```

In my setup I use an OTA Antenna, hence the Tuner option and have a KODI box on HDMI 1, and a Apple TV we use for Netflix on HDMI 2.  For the alexaName's "TV KODI", "TV TUNER", and "TV NETFLIX" these were not part of the Amazon documentation and may stop working at any time or may not work in your region.

* into - Name of the existing accessory to add the input function to.  In my setup this is my Apple TV accessory.

* manufacturer - Is the manufacturer of the accessory as shown in the Home App

* name - Is the name of the accessory as shown in the Home App

* alexaName - This the input your are asking Alexa to change to.

  }],
  "isApiEnabled": false
}
```

Also to enable turning on and off your Apple TV, add this to your homebridge-alexa configuration.

```
"combine": [{
      "into": "TV",
      "from": ["Power (TV)"]
    }]
```

#### Yamaha Spotify Controls

This uses the plugin homebridge-yamaha-home and a Yamaha Receiver which includes Spotify and Spotify Playback Controls.

#### New Parser

~~As of April 14, 2019 I changed the Homebridge device parser massively, to add support for Locks and Heater/Cooler devices.  To go back to the old device parser, you can set an option oldParser to true.  Default is to the new parser.~~

```
"oldParser": true
```

Support for the oldParser option was **deprecated** with version 0.5.0

## Initial Testing and confirming configuration

5. Start homebridge in DEBUG mode, to ensure configuration of homebridge-alexa is correct.  This will need to be executed with your implementations configuration options and as the same user as you are running homebridge. If you are homebridge with an autostart script ie systemd, you will need to stop the autostart temporarily.

ie
```
DEBUG=alexa* homebridge -I
```

6. Please ensure that homebridge starts without errors, and output should be similar to this.  This is from my setup, and I have several instances of homebridge so you may have a different number of alexaHAP lines.

```

Please note, that if you have other HomeKit devices on your network, like Philip's hue hub's, they will generate a `HAP Discover failed` message that can be ignored.

## Enable Homebridge smarthome skill and link accounts

7. In your Amazon Alexa app on your phone, please search for the "Homebridge" skill, and enable the skill.  You will need to Enable and link the skill to the account you created earlier on https://www.homebridge.ca/

## Discover Devices

8. At this point you are ready to have Alexa discover devices.  Once you say Alexa, discover devices, the output will get very verbose for a minute.  After discovery is complete you should see a line showing the number of devices returned to Alexa.

ie

```
.
.
.
alexaTranslator Alexa Controllable Penny 22 +1ms
alexaTranslator Alexa Controllable Bart-Dev 0 +0ms
[2018-3-17 11:01:03] [Alexa] alexaDiscovery - returned 36 devices
```

In the event you have errors, or no devices returned please review your config.

Please note, as part of the verbose output from discovery devices, all your devices with the Alexa voice commands for each accessory are output in CSV format.  You could grab these, format them into something usable and share.

9. Installation is now complete, good luck and enjoy.

# Service Availability and Issues

## Homebridge cloud service monitoring ( homebridge.ca )

* Contact Sensor **Alexa** monitors the connection to the cloud service.  When the contact sensor is **Closed**, the connection has been **successfully** made to the cloud service, and when the contact sensor is **Open** the connection to the cloud service has **not** been made. To determine why the connection to the cloud service is not working, please check your homebridge log files. During **normal** operation the Contact Sensor should be **Closed**.

* Real time monitoring of the homebridge.ca cloud service is provided by [Uptime Robot](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/2WmEDHyV6).

* Cloud service operational event reporting and alerting is sent to the #homebridge-alexa channel in the Homebridge Discord instance, and the uptime robot reports events there in real time.

## Raising Issues and Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting ###

<img align="right" src="docs/AccountStatus.png" height="200">

To assist in troubleshooting setup issues with your account, the hombridge.ca website displays the status of your account.

From here you should be able to determine if your plugin is communicating with the service and if your Amazon Alexa account has enabled the Homebridge-Alexa skill.

### Known Issues

* I have started recording troubleshooting tips here based on issues seen by the community [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.MD).
* All homebridge PIN's in your setup need to be set to the same value.
* An Alexa device or a software based Alexa is required. Using just the App or Website does not work, and device discovery will fail to find devices. The Reverb app is a software based Alexa that is known to work.
* The maximum number of supported devices is 300.  This is a limitation from the from the Amazon side, and not the plugin.
* If your Amazon account is not domiciled in the country where your Alexa is located the skill will not work.  This is a limitation on the Amazon side and not with the plugin.  ie if you are in the UK and use an Amazon.com account, the skill will not work.  You need to use an Amazon account domiciled in the UK

### Discord Channel

I have created a Discord channel on the homebridge discord server to troubleshoot issues not on the troubleshooting page.  If you reach out there, I'm usually available.  The channel is called #homebridge-alexa

### Debug logs

To collect a debug log, please start homebridge with this command line

```
DEBUG=* homebridge -I
```

### Homebridge Accessory Dump

Sometimes during troubleshooting I need a dump of your homebridge accessories. Please use this command to collect it.  If needed you can change the ip address, port or pin to match your environment.

```
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:51826/accessories --header "Content-Type:Application/json" --header "authorization: 031-45-154"
```
